The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:last-child` pseudo-class with floated elements:

```css
.container {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  float: left;
}

.item:last-child {
  clear: both;
}
```

When the number of `.item` elements is not a multiple of 3, the last element will clear the float, causing the container to collapse unexpectedly. This is because the `clear: both` is applied to a floated element.
